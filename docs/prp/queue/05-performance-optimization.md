# PRP-05: Performance Optimization

## Status: QUEUED
## Created: 2025-09-08
## Target Completion: Week 9

## Objective
Optimize application performance to achieve sub-100ms theme switching, <3s Time to Interactive on 3G, and maintain 60fps animations across all interactions.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Lighthouse Performance score >95
- [ ] Theme switch <100ms
- [ ] TTI <3s on 3G
- [ ] FCP <1.5s
- [ ] CLS <0.1
- [ ] Bundle size <200KB gzipped
- [ ] 60fps animations
- [ ] Memory usage <50MB

## Optimization Strategies

### Build Optimizations
- Tree shaking unused code
- Code splitting by route
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Preact compat for smaller bundle
- CSS purging for unused styles

### Runtime Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling for long lists
- Image lazy loading with blur placeholders
- Debounced/throttled event handlers
- Web Workers for heavy computations
- RequestIdleCallback for non-critical work

### Caching Strategies
- Aggressive asset caching
- API response caching
- Computed value memoization
- Component result caching
- Service Worker optimizations

## Monitoring
- Performance budgets in CI
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Synthetic monitoring
- Error tracking
- Bundle size tracking

## Dependencies
- @next/bundle-analyzer
- lighthouse-ci
- web-vitals
