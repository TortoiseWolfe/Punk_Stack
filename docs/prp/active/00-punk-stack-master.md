# PRP-00: Punk Stack Master Plan

## Status: OVERARCHING
## Created: 2025-09-08
## Type: Master Document (Permanent)

## Vision
Build a modern, offline-first Progressive Web App with a punk aesthetic theme system that showcases design system flexibility while maintaining peak performance and accessibility.

## Core Principles
1. **Offline-First**: Full functionality without network connectivity
2. **Theme Diversity**: 12 distinct punk aesthetics (6 styles × 2 modes)
3. **Performance**: Sub-100ms interactions, <3s TTI on 3G
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA minimum, AAA where possible
5. **Developer Experience**: Docker-first, TDD, clear documentation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- [ACTIVE] PRP-01: Theme System Implementation
- Core component library setup
- Testing infrastructure
- Docker development environment

### Phase 2: Progressive Enhancement (Weeks 3-5)
- [QUEUED] PRP-02: PWA & Offline-First
- Service worker implementation
- Cache strategies
- Install flow

### Phase 3: Component Library (Weeks 5-7)
- [QUEUED] PRP-03: Core Components
- Navigation components
- Form components
- Display components
- All components theme-aware

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-9)
- [QUEUED] PRP-04: Data Persistence
- IndexedDB integration
- Sync strategies
- Conflict resolution

### Phase 5: Polish & Deploy (Weeks 9-10)
- [QUEUED] PRP-05: Performance Optimization
- [QUEUED] PRP-06: GitHub Pages Deployment
- Analytics integration
- Documentation site

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Lighthouse PWA Score: >90
- Lighthouse Performance: >95
- Bundle Size: <200KB gzipped
- Theme Switch: <100ms
- Offline Load: <500ms

### Quality Metrics
- Test Coverage: >80%
- WCAG Compliance: AA (100%)
- Browser Support: Last 2 versions
- Zero runtime errors
- Zero accessibility violations

### User Experience Metrics
- Installable on all platforms
- Works fully offline
- Themes persist across sessions
- No layout shift on theme change
- Keyboard navigable throughout

## PRP Rotation Rules

### Active Slot Rules
- Maximum 1-2 PRPs active simultaneously
- Each PRP has 2-week implementation window
- Must pass all tests before rotation
- Documentation extracted before archival

### Queue Management
```
Queue → Active (1-2 max) → Implementation → Archive
         ↑                                      ↓
         └──────── If blocked/delayed ←────────┘
```

### Completion Criteria for Rotation
1. ✅ All success criteria met
2. ✅ Tests written and passing
3. ✅ Code commented with PRP references
4. ✅ ADRs extracted for key decisions
5. ✅ Archive with completion notes

## Architecture Decisions (Extracted from PRPs)

### ADR-001: DaisyUI over Material-UI
- **Decision**: Use DaisyUI for theming
- **Rationale**: Better theme flexibility, smaller bundle
- **Source**: PRP-01 implementation

### ADR-002: Service Worker over App Cache
- **Decision**: Modern service worker approach
- **Rationale**: More control, better debugging
- **Source**: PRP-02 (pending)

### ADR-003: Docker-First Development
- **Decision**: Require Docker for all development
- **Rationale**: Consistency across environments
- **Source**: Initial setup

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **GitHub Pages Limitations**: Plan for service worker scope issues
- **Safari PWA Support**: Graceful degradation strategy
- **Theme Performance**: CSS variables only, no runtime JS

### Process Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict PRP boundaries
- **Documentation Drift**: Immediate rotation to code
- **Test Debt**: TDD enforced, tests before implementation

## Dependencies & Constraints

### External Dependencies
- Next.js 15+ (React 19 support)
- DaisyUI v5 (Tailwind v4 support)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- GitHub Pages hosting

### Constraints
- Must work on 3G networks
- Must support last 2 browser versions
- Must be installable as PWA
- Must work fully offline

## Communication & Updates

### PRP Status Tracking
- Active PRPs: `/docs/prp/active/`
- Queued PRPs: `/docs/prp/queue/`
- Archived PRPs: `/docs/prp/archive/`

### Progress Indicators
- Git commits reference PRP numbers
- Tests validate PRP requirements
- Comments link to original PRPs

## Long-term Vision

### Year 1: Foundation
- Complete theme system
- Full PWA implementation
- Core component library
- GitHub Pages deployment

### Year 2: Expansion
- Additional punk themes
- Community theme creation
- Plugin system
- Multi-language support

### Year 3: Ecosystem
- Theme marketplace
- Component extensions
- Design system toolkit
- Enterprise features

## Notes
This master PRP remains active throughout the project lifecycle. It serves as the north star while individual PRPs rotate through implementation. Unlike other PRPs, this document is updated rather than archived, maintaining the overall vision and tracking macro-level progress.
