A modern design system featuring 12 distinct themes (6 punk aesthetics Ã— 2 modes) built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose

## Getting Started

This is a **Docker-first** project. All development should happen through Docker containers to ensure consistency across environments.

### Start Development Server

```bash
# Start the development environment
docker compose up dev

# Or run in background
docker compose up -d dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The application auto-updates as you edit files thanks to volume mounts and hot reload configuration.

### Other Commands

```bash
# Run tests
docker compose run --rm test

# Build production image (local testing)
docker compose --profile production up prod

# Stop all containers
docker compose down

# Rebuild containers (after dependency changes)
docker compose build dev
```
